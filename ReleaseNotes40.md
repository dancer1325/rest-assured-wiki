## Contents

1. [Non-backward compatible changes](#non-backward-compatible-changes)
1. [Minor Changes](#minor-changes)

## Highlights
* REST Assured now requires at least Java 8 (previous Java 6 was required)
* Added support for [Apache Johnzon](https://johnzon.apache.org/) (thanks to Andriy Redko for pull request)
* Fixed a lot of issues with the OSGi support to avoid creating duplicate classes in the distributed jar-files. In order the achieve this we had to move certain classes and packages around. This is what warranted the 4.0 release. (big thanks to Milen Dyankov, Steven Huypens and Mark Kolich for the help!) 
* Updated Groovy from 2.4.x to 2.5.x (enabled by the move to Java 8)
* Upgraded Hamcrest from version 1.3 to 2.1 (enabled by the move to Java 8)
* Made it possible to specify a multi-expectation body with arguments. For example:
  ```java
  when().
          get("/jsonStore").
  then().
          rootPath("store.book.find { it.author == '%s' }").
          body(
                  "price", withArgs("Nigel Rees"), is(8.95f),
                  "price", withArgs("Evelyn Waugh"), is(12.99f)
          );
  ```
* Several upgrades to the Spring MockMvc module (big thanks to Gemini Kim for a lot of help)
